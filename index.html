            <div id= "content">

              <p>I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who is continuing to learn coding and continue my trade of massage therapy. When I'm not doing either of those, I have fun with crochet, baking from scratch, reading and watch Big Bang Theory.  My top three books that I've read this year are Everything is Figureoutable by Marie Forleo, The Hidden Oracle by Rick Riordan, and Behind the Throne by K.B. Wagers.</p>

            <div class="div-1">
                <p> I was born in Littleton, CO and I love to read. I grew going to work with my mom who had her own business that traveled locally all over the state.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p> There really wasn't much to do in the car except what I had with me. Generally books, listen to music, and play on the laptop. Sometimes I'd color but the roads were bumpy so coloring wasn't a prefered option on the road. When I was home I liked watching movies and playing video games like Spyro and ZooTycoon.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p> Now, when I'm not at work, I crochet, I read, and ocassionally try baking from scratch. My most recent acquistion of skills is coding. I still play video games ocassionally but not as often as the other hobbies.</p>
